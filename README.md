# ironbci-32
ironbci-32 is a 32-channel, 24-bit EEG acquisition system.  

ironbci-32 integrates four 8-channel AD7771 analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), each with ultra-low-noise sources and references (measured at less than 0.22 μV), ensuring highly accurate signal capture. At its core is the STM32H7 ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller, which not only manages data collection but also performs real-time pre-processing for optimal performance. With its remarkable sensitivity and robust architecture, ironbci-32 delivers reliable, high-quality EEG data and supports a broad range of advanced biosignal acquisition applications
